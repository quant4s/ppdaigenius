This DSL approach to describing\n   * animations allows for a flexibility that both benefits developers and the framework.\n   *\n   * Animations work by listening on state changes that occur on an element within\n   * the template. When a state change occurs, Angular can then take advantage and animate the\n   * arc in between. This works similar to how CSS transitions work, however, by having a\n   * programmatic DSL, animations are not limited to environments that are DOM-specific.\n   * (Angular can also perform optimizations behind the scenes to make animations more performant.)\n   *\n   * For animations to be available for use, animation state changes are placed within\n   * {@link trigger animation triggers} which are housed inside of the `animations` annotation\n   * metadata. Within a trigger both {@link state state} and {@link transition transition} entries\n   * can be placed.\n   *\n   * ```typescript\n   * @Component({\n   *   selector: 'animation-cmp',\n   *   templateUrl: 'animation-cmp.html',\n   *   animations: [\n   *     // this here is our animation trigger that\n   *     // will contain our state change animations.\n   *     trigger('myTriggerName', [\n   *       // the styles defined for the `on` and `off`\n   *       // states declared below are persisted on the\n   *       // element once the animation completes.\n   *       state('on', style({ opacity: 1 }),\n   *       state('off', style({ opacity: 0 }),\n   *\n   *       // this here is our animation that kicks off when\n   *       // this state change jump is true\n   *       transition('on => off', [\n   *         animate(\"1s\")\n   *       ])\n   *     ])\n   *   ]\n   * })\n   * ```\n   *\n   * As depicted in the code above, a group of related animation states are all contained within\n   * an animation `trigger` (the code example above called the trigger `myTriggerName`).\n   * When a trigger is created then it can be bound onto an element within the component's\n   * template via a property prefixed by an `@` symbol followed by trigger name and an expression\n   * that\n   * is used to determine the state value for that trigger.\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <!-- animation-cmp.html -->\n   * <div @myTriggerName=\"expression\">...</div>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * For state changes to be executed, the `expression` value must change value from its existing\n   * value\n   * to something that we have set an animation to animate on (in the example above we are listening\n   * to a change of state between `on` and `off`).

The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n * \n * ### Local Variables\n * \n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n * \n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n * \n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n * \n * ### Change Propagation\n * \n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n * \n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n * \n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n * \n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n * \n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n * \n * ### Syntax\n * \n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * \n * With `<ng-template>` element:\n * \n * ```\n * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * ### Example\n * \n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n * \n * \\@stable\n */\nexport class NgForOf<T> implements DoCheck, OnChanges {\n   ngForOf: NgIterable<T>;\n/**\n * @param {?} fn\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngForTrackBy(fn: TrackByFunction<T>) {\n    if (isDevMode() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n      // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n      if ( /** @type {?} */((<any>console)) && /** @type {?} */(( <any>console.warn))) {\n        console.warn(\n            `trackBy must be a function, but received ${JSON.stringify(fn)}. ` +\n            `See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.`);\n      }\n    }\n    this._trackByFn = fn;\n  }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nget ngForTrackBy(): TrackByFunction<T> { return this._trackByFn; }\nprivate _differ: IterableDiffer<T> = null;\nprivate _trackByFn: TrackByFunction<T>;\n/**\n * @param {?} _viewContainer\n * @param {?} _template\n * @param {?} _differs\n */\nconstructor(\nprivate _viewContainer: ViewContainerRef,\nprivate _template: TemplateRef<NgForOfContext<T>>,\nprivate _differs: IterableDiffers) {}\n/**\n * @param {?} value\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngForTemplate(value: TemplateRef<NgForOfContext<T>>) {\n    // TODO(TS2.1): make TemplateRef<Partial<NgForRowOf<T>>> once we move to TS v2.1\n    // The current type is too restrictive; a template that just uses index, for example,\n    // should be acceptable.\n    if (value) {\n      this._template = value;\n    }\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} changes\n * @return {?}\n */\nngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {\n    if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n      // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n      const /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n      if (!this._differ && value) {\n        try {\n          this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this.ngForTrackBy);\n        } catch ( /** @type {?} */e) {\n          throw new Error(\n              `Cannot find a differ supporting object '${value}' of type '${getTypeNameForDebugging(value)}'.

Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n * \n * # Using non-inlined `then` template\n * \n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n * \n * # Storing conditional result in a variable\n * \n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in folowing example:\n * \n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n * \n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n * \n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n * \n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n * \n * ### Syntax\n * \n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<div template=\"ngIf condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n * \n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * Form with a `then` and `else` block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock\"></div>\n * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * Form with storing the value locally:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition as value; else elseBlock\">{{value}}</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * \\@stable\n */\nexport class NgIf {\nprivate _context: NgIfContext = new NgIfContext();\nprivate _thenTemplateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext> = null;\nprivate _elseTemplateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext> = null;\nprivate _thenViewRef: EmbeddedViewRef<NgIfContext> = null;\nprivate _elseViewRef: EmbeddedViewRef<NgIfContext> = null;\n/**\n * @param {?} _viewContainer\n * @param {?} templateRef\n */\nconstructor(private _viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext>) {\n    this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} condition\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngIf(condition: any) {\n    this._context.$implicit = this._context.ngIf = condition;\n    this._updateView();\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} templateRef\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngIfThen(templateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext>) {\n    this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n    this._thenViewRef = null;

Each property can be prefixed\n * by a special character designating its type:\n *\n * - (no prefix): property is a string.\n * - `*`: property represents an event.\n * - `!`: property is a boolean.\n * - `#`: property is a number.\n * - `%`: property is an object.\n *\n * ## Query\n *\n * The class creates an internal squas representation which allows to easily answer the query of\n * if a given property exist on a given element.\n *\n * NOTE: We don't yet support querying for types or events.\n * NOTE: This schema is auto extracted from `schema_extractor.ts` located in the test folder,\n *       see dom_element_schema_registry_spec.ts\n */\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n// =========== S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P  ===========\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n//\n//                       DO NOT EDIT THIS DOM SCHEMA WITHOUT A SECURITY REVIEW!\n//\n// Newly added properties must be security reviewed and assigned an appropriate SecurityContext in\n// dom_security_schema.ts.

If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * ### Caveat: Option selection\n * \n * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n * \n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.\n * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.\n * \n * #### Syntax\n * \n * ```\n * <select [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCountries\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n * \n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n * \n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n * \n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n * \n * \\@stable\n */\nexport class SelectControlValueAccessor implements ControlValueAccessor {\n  value: any;\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_optionMap: Map<string, any> = new Map<string, any>();\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_idCounter: number = 0;\n\n  onChange = (_: any) => {};\n  onTouched = () => {};\n/**\n * @param {?} fn\n * @return {?}\n */\nset compareWith(fn: (o1: any, o2: any) => boolean) {\n    if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n      throw new Error(`compareWith must be a function, but received ${JSON.stringify(fn)}`);\n    }\n    this._compareWith = fn;\n  }\nprivate _compareWith: (o1: any, o2: any) => boolean = looseIdentical;\n/**\n * @param {?} _renderer\n * @param {?} _elementRef\n */\nconstructor(private _renderer: Renderer,\nprivate _elementRef: ElementRef) {}\n/**\n * @param {?} value\n * @return {?}\n */\nwriteValue(value: any): void {\n    this.value = value;\n    const /** @type {?} */ id: string = this._getOptionId(value);\n    if (id == null) {\n      this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n    }\n    const /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n    this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} fn\n * @return {?}\n */\nregisterOnChange(fn: (value: any) => any): void {\n    this.onChange = (valueString: string) => {\n      this.value = valueString;\n      fn(this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n    };\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} fn\n * @return {?}\n */\nregisterOnTouched(fn: () => any): void { this.onTouched = fn; }\n/**\n * @param {?} isDisabled\n * @return {?}\n */\nsetDisabledState(isDisabled: boolean): void {\n    this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n  }\n/**\n * \\@internal\n * @return {?}\n */\n_registerOption(): string { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); }\n/**\n * \\@internal\n * @param {?} value\n * @return {?}\n */\n_getOptionId(value: any): string {\n    for (const /** @type {?} */ id of Array.from(this._optionMap.keys())) {\n      if (this._compareWith(this._optionMap.get(id), value)) return id;\n    }\n    return null;\n  }\n/**\n * \\@internal\n * @param {?} valueString\n * @return {?}\n */\n_getOptionValue(valueString: string): any {\n    const /** @type {?} */ id: string = _extractId(valueString);\n    return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n * \n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link \\@Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n * \n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n * \n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n * \n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you.

Each one has the following properties:\n *\n * - `path` is a string that uses the route matcher DSL.\n * - `pathMatch` is a string that specifies the matching strategy.\n * - `matcher` defines a custom strategy for path matching and supersedes `path` and `pathMatch`.\n *   See {@link UrlMatcher} for more info.\n * - `component` is a component type.\n * - `redirectTo` is the url fragment which will replace the current matched segment.\n * - `outlet` is the name of the outlet the component should be placed into.\n * - `canActivate` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanActivate handlers. See\n *   {@link CanActivate} for more info.\n * - `canActivateChild` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanActivateChild handlers. See\n *   {@link CanActivateChild} for more info.\n * - `canDeactivate` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanDeactivate handlers. See\n *   {@link CanDeactivate} for more info.\n * - `canLoad` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanDeactivate handlers. See\n *   {@link CanLoad} for more info.\n * - `data` is additional data provided to the component via `ActivatedRoute`.\n * - `resolve` is a map of DI tokens used to look up data resolvers. See {@link Resolve} for more\n *   info.\n * - `runGuardsAndResolvers` defines when guards and resovlers will be run. By default they run only\n *    when the matrix parameters of the route change. When set to `paramsOrQueryParamsChange` they\n *    will also run when query params change. And when set to `always`, they will run every time.\n * - `children` is an array of child route definitions.\n * - `loadChildren` is a reference to lazy loaded child routes. See {@link LoadChildren} for more\n *   info.\n *\n * ### Simple Configuration\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n  *  component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11/user/bob`, the router will create the team component with the user\n * component in it.\n *\n * ### Multiple Outlets\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team\n * }, {\n *   path: 'chat/:user',\n *   component: Chat\n *   outlet: 'aux'\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11(aux:chat/jim)`, the router will create the team component next to\n * the chat component. The chat component will be placed into the aux outlet.\n *\n * ### Wild Cards\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '**',\n *   component: Sink\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * Regardless of where you navigate to, the router will instantiate the sink component.\n *\n * ### Redirects\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: 'legacy/user/:name',\n *     redirectTo: 'user/:name'\n *   }, {\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to '/team/11/legacy/user/jim', the router will change the url to\n * '/team/11/user/jim', and then will instantiate the team component with the user component\n * in it.\n *\n * If the `redirectTo` value starts with a '/', then it is an absolute redirect. E.g., if in the\n * example above we change the `redirectTo` to `/user/:name`, the result url will be '/user/jim'.\n *\n * ### Empty Path\n *\n * Empty-path route configurations can be used to instantiate components that do not 'consume'\n * any url segments. Let's look at the following configuration:\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: '',\n *     component: AllUsers\n *   }, {\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11`, the router will instantiate the AllUsers component.\n *\n * Empty-path routes can have children.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: '',\n *     component: WrapperCmp,\n *     children: [{\n *       path: 'user/:name',\n *       component: User\n *     }]\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11/user/jim`, the router will instantiate the wrapper component with\n * the user component in it.\n *\n * An empty path route inherits its parent's params and data. This is because it cannot have its\n * own params, and, as a result, it often uses its parent's params and data as its own.\n *\n * ### Matching Strategy\n *\n * By default the router will look at what is left in the url, and check if it starts with\n * the specified path (e.g., `/team/11/user` starts with `team/:id`).\n *\n * We can change the matching strategy to make sure that the path covers the whole unconsumed url,\n * which is akin to `unconsumedUrl === path` or `$` regular expressions.\n *\n * This is particularly important when redirecting empty-path routes.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '',\n *   pathMatch: 'prefix', //default\n *   redirectTo: 'main'\n * }, {\n *   path: 'main',\n *   component: Main\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * Since an empty path is a prefix of any url, even when navigating to '/main', the router will\n * still apply the redirect.\n *\n * If `pathMatch: full` is provided, the router will apply the redirect if and only if navigating to\n * '/'.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '',\n *   pathMatch: 'full',\n *   redirectTo: 'main'\n * }, {\n *   path: 'main',\n *   component: Main\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Componentless Routes\n *\n * It is useful at times to have the ability to share parameters between sibling components.\n *\n * Say we have two components--ChildCmp and AuxCmp--that we want to put next to each other and both\n * of them require some id parameter.\n *\n * One way to do that would be to have a bogus parent component, so both the siblings can get the id\n * parameter from it. This is not ideal. Instead, you can use a componentless route.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *    path: 'parent/:id',\n *    children: [\n *      { path: 'a', component: MainChild },\n *      { path: 'b', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }\n *    ]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * So when navigating to `parent/10/(a//aux:b)`, the route will instantiate the main child and aux\n * child components next to each other. In this example, the application component\n * has to have the primary and aux outlets defined.\n *\n * The router will also merge the `params`, `data`, and `resolve` of the componentless parent into\n * the `params`, `data`, and `resolve` of the children. This is done because there is no component\n * that can inject the activated route of the componentless parent.\n *\n * This is especially useful when child components are defined as follows:\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *    path: 'parent/:id',\n *    children: [\n *      { path: '', component: MainChild },\n *      { path: '', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }\n *    ]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * With this configuration in place, navigating to '/parent/10' will create the main child and aux\n * components.\n *\n * ### Lazy Loading\n *\n * Lazy loading speeds up our application load time by splitting it into multiple bundles, and\n * loading them on demand.
